********************************************************************
8th Workshop on Intuitionistic Modal Logic and Applications (IMLA)
24–25 July 2026, Lisbon, Portugal
Affiliated with the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC 26)
https://sonia-marin.github.io/imla26/

Constructive and intuitionistic modal logics, and their connections with type theory and computation, remain foundationally and practically significant in computer science, logic, and related areas. These include applications in type disciplines, meta-logics for computational phenomena, and explanatory frameworks in philosophical logic. The workshop aims to explore theoretical and methodological issues at the intersection of constructive proof theory and modal semantics, as well as practical questions about which modal connectives and rules best capture computational phenomena at appropriate levels of abstraction.
